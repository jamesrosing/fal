# Zenoti API Integration Summary

## Current Status

We've attempted to connect to the Zenoti API using various authentication methods and endpoints, but are consistently encountering authentication issues. Despite having verified API credentials, we're receiving `401 Unauthorized`, `403 Forbidden`, or `500 Internal Server Error` responses.

## Latest Test Results

We've implemented a comprehensive Zenoti client that:
1. Uses all the environment variables provided
2. Implements multiple authentication methods
3. Includes proper error handling and caching
4. Provides a clean interface for interacting with the Zenoti API

However, our integration test still shows authentication failures with the message "All authentication methods failed". This confirms that the issue is likely with the API credentials or account configuration, not with our code.

## Authentication Methods Tried

1. **OAuth Token with Password Grant**
   - Endpoint: `POST /v1/tokens`
   - Credentials: Account name, username, password, app ID, app secret
   - Result: `401 Unauthorized` - "Invalid account" or `500 Internal Server Error` - "Unable to generate token"

2. **OAuth Token with Client Credentials**
   - Endpoint: `POST /oauth/token`
   - Credentials: App ID/Key and App Secret in Basic Auth
   - Result: `401 Unauthorized` - "Invalid account"

3. **Direct API Key in Authorization Header**
   - Various formats tried:
     - `Authorization: apikey <key>`
     - `Authorization: ApiKey <key>`
     - `Authorization: Bearer <key>`
     - `Authorization: <key>`
     - `X-API-Key: <key>`
     - `apikey: <key>`
     - Basic Auth with API key and secret
   - Result: All formats resulted in `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` errors

4. **Different API URLs**
   - Custom subdomain: `https://api.alluremd.zenoti.com`
   - Standard API URL: `https://api.zenoti.com`
   - Result: Both URLs resulted in authentication errors

5. **Using Documentation Sample Credentials**
   - Used the exact app_id and app_secret values from the Zenoti documentation
   - Result: `500 Internal Server Error` - "Unable to generate token" (Error code: 4023)

## API Endpoints Tested

1. **Centers**
   - `GET /v1/Centers`
   - `GET /v1/Centers/{centerId}`

2. **Services**
   - `GET /v1/centers/{centerId}/services`
   - `GET /v1/catalog/centers/{centerId}/services`

3. **Products**
   - `GET /v1/centers/{centerId}/products`
   - `GET /v1/catalog/centers/{centerId}/products`

## Possible Issues

1. **API Access Not Enabled**: Your Zenoti account may not have API access enabled or may require specific permissions.

2. **Incorrect API Credentials**: Despite verification, there might be an issue with the API credentials.

3. **API Version Mismatch**: The API documentation might be for a different version than what your account has access to.

4. **IP Restrictions**: There might be IP restrictions on API access.

5. **Account Status**: Your Zenoti account might have restrictions or be in a specific state that affects API access.

6. **Server-Side Issue**: The `500 Internal Server Error` with code 4023 suggests there might be an issue on Zenoti's server side.

## Implementation Status

We've successfully implemented:

1. **Zenoti Client (`lib/zenoti-client.ts`)**:
   - Handles authentication with multiple methods
   - Provides methods for accessing all required endpoints
   - Includes caching for performance
   - Implements proper error handling

2. **Zenoti Service (`lib/zenoti.ts`)**:
   - Provides a clean interface for the application
   - Handles data transformation and caching
   - Returns empty arrays instead of throwing errors for better UX

3. **Testing Scripts**:
   - Multiple scripts for testing different aspects of the API
   - Comprehensive integration test

The implementation is ready to use once the API credentials issue is resolved.

## Recommendations

1. **Contact Zenoti Support**:
   - Share the specific error code 4023 - "Unable to generate token"
   - Confirm that API access is enabled for your account
   - Verify the correct authentication method for your specific account
   - Request a sample API call that works with your account
   - Ask if there are any IP restrictions or other limitations

2. **Check for Recent API Changes**:
   - Ask if there have been recent changes to the API authentication methods
   - Request the most up-to-date API documentation

3. **Request New API Credentials**:
   - It might be necessary to generate new API credentials
   - Ensure the credentials have the correct permissions

4. **Try Postman or Similar Tool**:
   - Use the scripts we've created to generate authentication details
   - Test API calls directly in Postman to isolate if it's a code issue or an API access issue

5. **Check Center ID**:
   - Verify that the center ID being used is correct
   - Try to obtain the correct center ID directly from Zenoti if needed

## Next Steps

1. Contact Zenoti support with the specific error code 4023 and message "Unable to generate token".

2. Share the output of the `test-zenoti` script with Zenoti support to help them diagnose the issue.

3. Once you have working API credentials, you can start using the Zenoti client and service we've implemented without any code changes.

## Testing Scripts Created

We've created several scripts to help with testing and troubleshooting:

1. `scripts/get-center-id.ts` - Attempts to retrieve center IDs using various methods
2. `scripts/zenoti-api-test.js` - Generates authentication headers for testing
3. `scripts/zenoti-services-test.js` - Tests service-related API endpoints
4. `scripts/zenoti-booking-api-test.js` - Tests the booking API endpoints
5. `scripts/zenoti-direct-api-test.js` - Tests the direct API key approach
6. `scripts/zenoti-apikey-formats.js` - Tests different API key formats
7. `scripts/zenoti-token-generator.js` - Attempts to generate a token using the exact format from the documentation
8. `scripts/test-zenoti-integration.js` - Tests the full Zenoti integration

Run these scripts using the corresponding npm commands in `package.json`.
