Let me continue with the remaining part of the updated chat API route file:



Now, let's create a new UI component that will allow users to interact with the marketing features in your application:

Let me continue with the rest of the Marketing Feature Component:

Now, let's create the API routes needed to support our marketing features:



Finally, let's create a sample page that demonstrates how to integrate the marketing features into your Next.js application:



## Implementation Strategy and Key Considerations

Based on the analysis of the Zenoti documentation and marketing features, here's a strategic guide to successfully implement these marketing capabilities in your Next.js application:

### 1. Core Marketing Features Integration

I've provided comprehensive implementation code for all the marketing features mentioned in the Zenoti documentation:

- **Discounts**: Apply percentage or fixed amount discounts to bookings
- **Campaigns and Coupons**: Manage promotions and redeem coupon codes
- **Target Segments**: Access customer segments for targeted marketing
- **Gift Cards**: Create, validate, and redeem gift cards
- **Gift Card Promotions**: Apply special promotions to gift card purchases
- **Loyalty Points**: Check and redeem loyalty points during booking
- **Prepaid Cards**: Manage and apply prepaid service cards
- **Abandoned Checkouts**: Track and recover abandoned purchases

### 2. Integration Architecture

The implementation follows the same architecture as your existing Zenoti integration:

1. **Backend Service Layer**: `ZenotiMarketingService` complements your existing `ZenotiService` to handle marketing features
2. **OpenAI Function Calls**: Expanded function definitions for AI assistant to handle marketing queries
3. **API Routes**: New routes to support all marketing features
4. **UI Components**: Reusable React components to display and interact with marketing features
5. **Chat Integration**: Updated chat API to handle marketing-related queries

### 3. Implementation Steps

Follow these steps to implement the marketing integration:

1. Add the `zenoti-marketing.ts` service to your `/lib` directory
2. Add the marketing functions to your OpenAI function calls
3. Update your chat API route to include the marketing function handlers
4. Create the API routes for each marketing feature
5. Add the `MarketingFeatures` component to your UI where needed
6. Create a test page to verify the integration works correctly

### 4. Data Flow

The data flow follows this pattern:

1. User interacts with UI or asks a question in the chat interface
2. Request goes to the appropriate API route
3. API route calls the `ZenotiMarketingService` methods
4. `ZenotiMarketingService` calls the Zenoti API with proper authentication
5. Results are returned to the UI or chat interface

### 5. AI Assistant Integration

The AI assistant can now help users with marketing-related queries:

- Find available discounts
- Apply coupon codes
- Create and redeem gift cards
- Check loyalty point balance
- Recommend promotions based on user history

### 6. Testing Considerations

When testing this implementation:

1. Verify API connections with Zenoti using the logging in development mode
2. Test each marketing feature individually before integrating
3. Check error handling for all API calls
4. Verify the chat assistant correctly understands and processes marketing queries
5. Test the UI components with various screen sizes

### 7. Security Considerations

Ensure you:

1. Never expose API keys or secrets in client-side code
2. Validate all inputs on both client and server side
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Use proper authentication for API routes

By following this implementation plan, you'll have a fully-featured Zenoti marketing integration in your Next.js application that provides a seamless experience for your users and leverages the AI assistant to make marketing features more accessible.
