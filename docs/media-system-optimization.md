# Media System Optimization Plan

## Current Issues

After a thorough review of the codebase, we've identified several issues with the current media handling system:

1. **Multiple overlapping implementations**:
   - CloudinaryImage, CloudinaryVideo (original)
   - OptimizedImage, OptimizedVideo (improved versions)
   - UnifiedMedia (consolidation attempt)
   - Multiple utility functions with similar functionality
   - Inconsistent error handling between implementations

2. **Error handling weaknesses**:
   - Several edge cases where undefined or null values can cause runtime errors
   - Insufficient fallback mechanisms
   - Placeholder images referenced but not provided

3. **Inconsistent registry usage**:
   - Media registry system inconsistently used across components
   - Redundant API calls for the same media assets
   - No clear pattern for fallbacks when registry lookups fail

## Immediate Fixes Implemented

1. **Improved error handling in UnifiedMedia component**:
   - Added defensive programming to prevent TypeErrors
   - Ensured all error paths lead to fallback images
   - Wrapped error-prone code in try/catch blocks

2. **Created placeholder documentation**:
   - Added placeholder file indicators to guide future development
   - Documented required placeholder images

## Recommended Path Forward

### Phase 1: Consolidation

1. **Audit all media components and usage**:
   - Identify all components that handle media
   - Create usage inventory showing which components are used where
   - Document the input patterns and expected outputs

2. **Create single source of truth**:
   - Develop a robust Media service with clear interface
   - Consolidate all utility functions (getMediaUrl, getCloudinaryUrl, etc.)
   - Implement comprehensive error handling with meaningful logs

3. **Placeholder assets**:
   - Create appropriate placeholder images for different contexts
   - Implement fallback strategy based on context (hero, team, gallery, etc.)

### Phase 2: Standardization

1. **Migration plan to UnifiedMedia**:
   - Update components to use UnifiedMedia consistently
   - Deprecate older media components
   - Document migration patterns for developers

2. **Performance optimization**:
   - Implement proper image dimensions for each context
   - Add responsive image handling with srcset
   - Optimize loading strategies (priority, lazy) based on context

3. **Registry improvement**:
   - Enhance media registry with robust caching
   - Add observability for media load failures
   - Create management interface for placeholder mappings

### Phase 3: Enhancement

1. **Advanced features**:
   - Add art direction support (different images for different viewports)
   - Implement image formats based on browser support (WebP, AVIF)
   - Add focal point support for responsive cropping

2. **Analytics and monitoring**:
   - Track media load performance and failures
   - Identify most common missing media assets
   - Measure impact on Core Web Vitals

## Implementation Notes

The key principle should be progressive enhancement with backward compatibility. This allows for incremental improvement without breaking existing functionality.

Key steps:

1. Fix immediate issues (done)
2. Create consolidated media service
3. Migrate components in order of importance
4. Deprecate legacy components

This approach ensures that the website continues to function while improvements are made incrementally.
