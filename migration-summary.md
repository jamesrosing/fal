## Migration Process

The migration process involved three main scripts:

1. **Media Component Migration (`migrate-media.js`)**
   - Replaced Next.js `<Image>` components using Cloudinary URLs with `<OptimizedImage>` components
   - Replaced `<video>` tags with `<OptimizedVideo>` components
   - Added necessary imports for the new components

2. **String Literal URL Migration (`migrate-string-urls.js`)**
   - Located and replaced hardcoded Cloudinary URLs in string literals
   - Replaced URLs in object properties with `mediaId()` and `mediaUrl()` function calls
   - Added necessary imports for the media helper functions

3. **Component-Specific Migration (`migrate-component-specific.js`)**
   - Targeted specific files with complex patterns
   - Applied custom replacements for each file
   - Handled edge cases like template literals with dynamic values

4. **Manual Fixes**
   - Manually updated several files with complex patterns that the automated scripts couldn't handle
   - Fixed TypeScript errors in migrated code
   - Added helper functions in `lib/media.ts`

## Remaining Issues

There are still a few issues remaining:

1. **Contact Page (2 issues)**
   - The contact page has HTML templates with image tags generated at runtime
   - This content is used for dynamic Google Maps integration

2. **Video Components (2 issues)**
   - `CloudinaryVideo.tsx` and `OptimizedVideo.tsx` have some issues with URLs
   - These are specialized components that need careful refactoring

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure all media loads correctly
   - Check browser console for 404 errors or missing images

2. **Manual Fixes**
   - Address the remaining issues with the contact page and video components
   - Consider rewriting templates to use placeholder IDs instead of direct URLs

3. **Media Registry**
   - Update the media registry with all discovered assets
   - Create placeholders for common assets like profile images

4. **Documentation**
   - Update documentation with the new media component patterns
   - Create guidelines for developers to use the new system

## Migration Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All media references now follow the same pattern
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation between media references and URLs
3. **Developer Experience**: Easier to find and reference media assets
4. **Performance**: Properly optimized images with consistent delivery
5. **Next.js Compatibility**: Improved compatibility with Next.js 15+
