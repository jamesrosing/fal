    title: "Breast Augmentation",
    description: "Enhance breast size and shape with implants or fat transfer.",
    story: "Breast augmentation is a uniquely personal journey for each woman. Some of our patients have always desired more volume, while others are looking to restore fullness lost after pregnancy or weight changes. We take a personalized approach to create natural-looking results that complement your figure and boost confidence. Many patients tell us they finally feel comfortable in clothing they've always loved but never felt quite right in, or that their proportions finally feel balanced with the rest of their body.",

    title: "Breast Lift (Mastopexy)",
    description: "Restore a more youthful breast position and shape.",
    story: "A breast lift can be transformative for women who've experienced changes in their breast shape due to pregnancy, weight fluctuations, or simply the natural aging process. This procedure doesn't change your size, but rather restores the youthful position and contour that time has altered. Patients often share how a breast lift has helped them feel more confident in intimate settings and how clothing fits better than it has in years. It's remarkable how this procedure can help women reclaim a part of themselves they thought was lost to time.",

  },
  {
    title: "Breast Reduction",
    description: "Achieve more proportionate breasts and relieve discomfort.",
    story: "Breast reduction is as much about comfort as it is aesthetics. Our patients who choose this procedure often tell us about years of back pain, shoulder grooves from bra straps, and difficulty finding clothes that fit properly. After surgery, they frequently mention how liberating it feels to engage in physical activities without discomfort or self-consciousness. Many wish they'd had the procedure sooner after experiencing the physical relief and newfound confidence that comes with having breasts in proportion with their body frame.",
    imageId: "fal/pages/services/plastic-surgery/breast/breast-reduction"
  },
  {
    title: "Breast Revision",
    description: "Correct or improve previous breast surgery results.",
    story: "Breast revision surgery represents our commitment to ensuring every patient achieves their desired outcome, even if their initial procedure wasn't performed by us. Women seek revision for many reasonsâ€”from changes in personal preference to addressing complications or unsatisfactory results from previous surgeries. We approach each case with fresh eyes and advanced techniques to help patients finally achieve the results they've been hoping for. The satisfaction that comes from helping someone find resolution after disappointment is particularly rewarding for our surgical team.",

  },
  {
    title: "Nipple & Areola Procedures",
    description: "Enhance or correct nipple and areola appearance.",
    story: "Nipple and areola refinements may seem like subtle changes, but they can have a profound impact on how women feel about their breasts overall. These procedures address concerns like overly large areolas, inverted nipples, or asymmetry that can affect confidence and comfort. Patients are often amazed at how these relatively minor adjustments can enhance the overall aesthetic result of their breast procedures. For many, it's the finishing touch that helps them feel completely comfortable and confident with their appearance.",
