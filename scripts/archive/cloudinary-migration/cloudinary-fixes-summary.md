# Cloudinary Integration Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **API Compatibility Updates for Cloudinary v6.0.0+**
   - Updated `autoPlay` to `autoplay` in all Cloudinary components (breaking change in v6.0.0)
   - Fixed event handler `onPlaying` to use `onPlay` in CldVideo component
   - Ensured CSS import `next-cloudinary/dist/cld-video-player.css` is present in all files using CldVideoPlayer
   - Updated type definitions to match the new Cloudinary API

2. **Path Formatting Standardization**
   - Removed leading slashes from publicIds to comply with Cloudinary's expected format
   - Fixed path formatting to ensure consistent reference to media assets
   - Added checks for potential invalid path formats (e.g., full URLs)

3. **Component Implementations**
   - Enhanced CldVideo component with better error handling and loading states
   - Fixed CldVideoWrapper to use consistent prop naming with the underlying CldVideoPlayer
   - Ensured HTML video elements use `autoPlay` (camelCase as required by React) while Cloudinary-specific components use `autoplay` (lowercase as required by Cloudinary)

4. **Configuration Validation**
   - Confirmed proper environment variables are set in .env:
     ```
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dyrzyfg3w
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=956447123689192
     CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=zGsan0MXgwGKIGnQ0t1EVKYSqg0
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=emsculpt
     ```

## Scripts Created

1. **verify-cloudinary-css.ps1**
   - Ensures all components using CldVideoPlayer have the required CSS import
   - Automatically adds the import if missing

2. **fix-cloudinary-autoplay.ps1**
   - Fixes `autoPlay` to `autoplay` in CldVideoPlayer components
   - Updates component props for compatibility with Cloudinary v6.0.0+

3. **fix-cloudinary-publicids.ps1**
   - Fixes publicId formatting to ensure consistency
   - Removes leading slashes and checks for potentially invalid formats

4. **fix-cloudinary-all.ps1**
   - Master script that runs all fixes in sequence
   - Provides a comprehensive summary of changes made

## Test Implementation

Created a test page at `/example/cloudinary-test` that demonstrates:
1. Basic CldImage component
2. Direct CldVideoPlayer usage
3. Enhanced CldVideo component
4. CldVideoWrapper component
5. Display of Cloudinary environment variables

## Verification

To verify the fixes:
1. Run the application with `npm run dev`
2. Visit the test page at `/example/cloudinary-test`
3. Ensure all components load and display correctly
4. Check that videos play properly when controls are used
5. Verify environment variables are displayed correctly

## Next Steps

1. Run the application and test the home page hero video
2. Verify other pages using Cloudinary assets are working correctly
3. Ensure video controls and autoplay behavior are as expected
4. Consider implementing a more comprehensive media manager to simplify Cloudinary asset usage

# Cloudinary and Database Integration Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Merge Conflicts and Supabase Client
- Resolved merge conflicts in `lib/supabase.ts` by creating a clean implementation
- Created a consistent API between client and server components
- Fixed the TeamMember type to match the database schema (`is_provider` as string instead of boolean)
- Updated the Article interface to use `is_draft` instead of `status` field to match database

### 2. Team API Endpoint
- Updated the team API route to use a reliable database connection
- Added fallback data in case of database connection issues
- Improved error handling and logging
- Added fallback Supabase credentials to ensure API works even without proper environment configuration

### 3. Featured Articles API
- Updated to use `is_draft: false` instead of `status: 'published'`
- Mapped database schema to client-side interfaces for backward compatibility
- Ensured proper error handling with fallback content

### 4. Component Fixes
- Fixed ArticlesSection component to use proper CldImage import from '@/components/media/CldImage'
- Updated several components to handle string-format database values correctly (e.g., 'true'/'false' for is_provider)
- Added config objects with cloudName to CldImage and CldVideo components

### 5. Database Migrations
- Created proper migrations for team_members table
- Added RLS policies for database security
- Executed migration to populate initial data

## Next Steps

1. Verify more components and pages for Cloudinary import patterns
2. Test the application thoroughly on deployment
3. Consider updating the database schema to use proper boolean types
4. Update any remaining components using the old import patterns

## Database Schema Notes
- The team_members table uses string representations for boolean values
- The articles table uses boolean 'is_draft' instead of status enum
- Ensure all code handles these database schema patterns consistently
