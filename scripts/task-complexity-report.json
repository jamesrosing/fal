    {
      "taskId": 2,
      "taskTitle": "Database Schema Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a relational database schema in Supabase into subtasks, including table creation, field definitions, foreign key setup, index and constraint configuration, row-level security policy implementation, and testing for access control.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing multiple interrelated tables with foreign keys, indexes, and security policies in Supabase. The need for row-level security and correct relational mapping increases complexity, as does ensuring compliance with the PRD. Testing and validation are also critical, making this a high-complexity task."

      "taskId": 3,
      "taskTitle": "Authentication System Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the steps required to implement a secure authentication system using Supabase Auth, including user registration, login, role-based access control, protected routes, session management, and user profile storage.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing authentication with role-based access, protected routes, and session management is complex. It requires careful handling of security, integration with Supabase Auth, and frontend/backend coordination for user experience and data integrity."

      "taskId": 4,
      "taskTitle": "Cloudinary Media System Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the subtasks for integrating Cloudinary with a web application, including component creation for images and videos, media service setup, transformation utilities, upload functionality, and responsive image handling.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves third-party integration, custom component development, and handling both images and videos with transformations and uploads. While not as security-critical as auth, it requires careful planning for performance and maintainability."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 5,
      "taskTitle": "Core Pages and Layout Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Identify the main subtasks for building core public pages and layout components, including header/navigation, homepage, about/services pages, responsive design, and animation integration.",
      "reasoning": "Building core pages and layouts is standard but requires attention to design, responsiveness, and smooth user experience. The use of Framer Motion adds some complexity, but the patterns are well-established."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 6,
      "taskTitle": "Articles System Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Enumerate the steps for implementing an articles system, including database setup, list/detail pages, categorization, filtering, text-to-speech integration, and SEO optimization.",
      "reasoning": "This task combines database work, UI development, categorization, advanced features like text-to-speech, and SEO. The mix of backend and frontend requirements, plus accessibility and optimization, increases its complexity."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Gallery System Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the implementation of a hierarchical gallery system into subtasks, including list/detail pages for galleries, albums, and cases, dynamic routing, data fetching, image optimization, and filtering/sorting.",
      "reasoning": "Hierarchical data structures, dynamic routing, and performance optimizations (like lazy loading) make this task moderately complex. Ensuring smooth navigation and responsive design adds to the challenge."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 8,
      "taskTitle": "Admin Dashboard Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "List the main subtasks for building an admin dashboard with multiple management tabs, CRUD operations, analytics, media handling, user management, AI chat integration, and bulk upload support.",
      "reasoning": "The admin dashboard aggregates many complex features—CRUD, analytics, media management, AI integration, and bulk operations—requiring robust architecture, security, and UI/UX considerations. This breadth and depth make it highly complex."
    },
    {
      "taskId": 9,
      "taskTitle": "User Features Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Detail the subtasks for implementing user-centric features, including profile management, appointment booking, bookmark system, appointment history, notifications, and data fetching services.",
      "reasoning": "This task spans several user-facing features, each with its own data and UI requirements. Integrating notifications and managing user data securely adds to the complexity, though patterns are common in modern apps."

      "taskTitle": "LLM Chatbot Integration",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Identify the steps for integrating an LLM chatbot, including API integration, chat UI, context-aware response handling, appointment scheduling, chat history persistence, and analytics tracking.",
      "reasoning": "Integrating an LLM chatbot with context awareness, persistence, and analytics is complex due to the need for reliable API handling, real-time UI, and secure data management. The requirement for appointment scheduling and provider communication adds further intricacy."
