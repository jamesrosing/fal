# Active Context: Allure MD Web Application

## Current Work Focus

The project has made significant progress with the implementation of the database schema as specified in the PRD. We have successfully modified all relevant tables while preserving existing data. We have also implemented the core components of the Cloudinary Media System with `CldImage` and `CldVideo` components. Our next focus is on completing the full Cloudinary Media System integration.

## Recent Accomplishments

### Database Schema Implementation
- Completed major database schema changes:
  - Created a new `media_assets` table with the structure specified in the PRD
  - Updated `galleries`, `albums`, and `cases` tables with missing fields (slug, thumbnail_id, updated_at)
  - Created a new `case_images` table to replace the old `images` table
  - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
  - Successfully migrated all existing data to the new schema

### Cloudinary Components Implementation
- Created `CldImage` component with enhanced features:
  - Loading states with skeleton loading
  - Error handling with fallback images
  - Responsive image support
  - Quality and format optimizations
- Created `CldVideo` component with similar enhancements:
  - Loading states
  - Error handling with fallback videos
  - Responsive support
  - Proper event handling

## Current Status
- Task 2 (Database Schema Implementation) is complete
- Task 3 (Cloudinary Media System Integration) is partially complete
  - Core components are built
  - Still need to create utility functions and update references

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Cloudinary Media System Integration**:
   - Create utility functions for generating Open Graph images
   - Update Next.js configuration for Cloudinary
   - Create media service to interact with the new `media_assets` table
   - Develop script to migrate from placeholder system to direct public IDs

2. **Frontend Updates**:
   - Update code references to use new components
   - Clean up the codebase by removing deprecated components
   - Ensure proper responsive image handling

3. **Testing and Verification**:
   - Test the new schema with real data
   - Verify component rendering with various media types
   - Check performance metrics for optimized media delivery

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Migration Approach**:
   - We've preserved original tables with renames (e.g., `media_assets_old`) for safety
   - We'll need to update application code to use the new schema
   - Consider a phased approach for updating component references

2. **Component Usage**:
   - Need to determine best approach for component adoption
   - Could create adapter components for backward compatibility
   - Plan for gradual migration of existing code

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Ensure proper use of Cloudinary transformation parameters
   - Configure optimal image formats and quality settings
   - Implement responsive delivery for different devices
