# Active Context: UnifiedMedia System Implementation and Bug Fixes

## Current Focus

We're currently addressing several critical errors in the dev environment related to the unified media system, while also continuing SEO optimizations. Current focus areas include:

1. **UnifiedMedia Component**
   - ✅ Fixed critical bugs in CloudinaryVideo component (infinite update loop)
   - ✅ Fixed prop validation in UnifiedMedia to prevent width/fill conflicts
   - ✅ Improved error handling for placeholder ID resolution
   - ✅ Added fallback mappings for missing team provider placeholders
   - Next steps: Continue stabilizing the component and expanding test coverage

2. **Media Source Resolution**
   - ✅ Enhanced the placeholder ID resolution API for better error handling
   - ✅ Added fallback mappings for common missing placeholders
   - ✅ Improved error reporting for missing assets
   - Next steps: Implement better UI feedback for media loading states

3. **SEO Optimizations**
   - Continuing to implement structured data for key pages
   - Optimizing meta descriptions and titles for procedure pages
   - Implementing OG images for improved social sharing

## Recent Decisions

- **Added Fallback Mappings**: Instead of requiring all placeholder IDs to exist in the database, we've implemented a fallback strategy with hardcoded mappings for common placeholders.
- **Prop Handling in UnifiedMedia**: When conflicting props (both width/height and fill) are provided, we now prioritize 'fill' and ignore width/height to prevent errors.
- **CloudinaryVideo Performance**: Improved the CloudinaryVideo component's performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders and eliminating the infinite loop bug.

## Key Challenges

1. **Placeholder ID Resolution**: The system needs to reliably resolve placeholder IDs to actual media assets, with fallbacks through multiple sources:
   - Database mappings in media_mappings table
   - Registry entries in the media registry
   - Direct URLs if the placeholder ID is already a Cloudinary path

2. **Backwards Compatibility**: Ensuring existing components continue to work while migrating to the new system:
   - Created adapter components that map old props to the new system
   - Documented migration paths for different component types
   - Maintained consistent behavior across different implementation approaches

3. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing image quality with loading performance:
   - Implementing proper responsive images with appropriate sizes
   - Using modern formats (WebP, AVIF) with fallbacks
   - Ensuring Core Web Vitals metrics remain strong

4. **Critical Bugs in Production**:
   - **Maximum update depth exceeded in CloudinaryVideo**: Component is entering an infinite loop in useEffect, appearing in the Hero component.
   - **API 404 errors for team providers**: Missing placeholder mappings for "team-provider-rosing" and "team-provider-pearose" in TeamSection component.
   - **Image property conflicts**: UnifiedMedia component receiving both "width" and "fill" props, causing errors in Next.js Image component.

## Next Steps

1. **Fix Critical Bugs**:
   - Fix the infinite loop in CloudinaryVideo component's useEffect hook
   - Add missing team provider placeholder mappings to the database
   - Resolve the width/fill conflicts in UnifiedMedia component usage

2. **Integration Testing**: Test the UnifiedMedia component on key pages to ensure it renders correctly in all contexts.

3. **Migration Guide**: Create a detailed migration guide for developers to transition to the new system.

4. **Performance Analysis**: Analyze the impact of the new media system on Core Web Vitals.

5. **Component Library Documentation**: Update component documentation to highlight the new system.

6. **SEO Implementation**: Continue with the SEO implementation plan, focusing on structured data and metadata.

## Current Considerations

- Balancing comprehensive content with page performance
- Ensuring structured data is properly implemented across all page types
- Maintaining HIPAA compliance in lead generation forms
- Coordinating keyword implementation with existing content structure
- Implementing proper analytics to measure SEO impact
