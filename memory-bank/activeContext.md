# Active Context: Allure MD Web Application

## Current Work Focus

The project has made significant progress with the completion of both the Cloudinary Media System Integration (Task 3) and Authentication System Implementation (Task 5). We have successfully implemented all planned features for both systems and are now preparing to begin work on Task 4 (Article System Implementation).

## Recent Accomplishments

### Database Schema Implementation
- Completed major database schema changes:
  - Created a new `media_assets` table with the structure specified in the PRD
  - Updated `galleries`, `albums`, and `cases` tables with missing fields (slug, thumbnail_id, updated_at)
  - Created a new `case_images` table to replace the old `images` table
  - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
  - Successfully migrated all existing data to the new schema

### Cloudinary Media System Integration (COMPLETED)
- Created `CldImage` component with enhanced features:
  - Loading states with skeleton loading
  - Error handling with fallback images
  - Responsive image support
  - Quality and format optimizations
- Created `CldVideo` component with similar enhancements:
  - Loading states
  - Error handling with fallback videos
  - Responsive support
  - Proper event handling
- Created utility functions for Cloudinary transformations
- Updated Next.js configuration for Cloudinary
- Implemented media service for database interaction
- Created and executed migration script for placeholder system
- Updated `hooks/useMedia.tsx` to work with direct Cloudinary IDs
- Updated API routes to support both legacy placeholders and direct IDs
- Created SQL function for efficient legacy placeholder lookups

### Authentication System Implementation (COMPLETED)
- Created `user_profiles` table with RLS policies
- Implemented trigger for new user registration
- Updated middleware to protect admin routes and appointment booking
- Implemented login page with Supabase authentication
- Implemented create account page with user profile creation
- Added toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Set up role-based access control
- Created password reset functionality
- Implemented user profile management page
- Implemented password update functionality
- Modified middleware to only require login for specific features (admin routes, appointment booking, profile)

## Current Status
- Task 1 (Project Setup & Environment Configuration) is complete
- Task 2 (Database Schema Implementation) is complete
- Task 3 (Cloudinary Media System Integration) is complete
- Task 5 (Authentication System Implementation) is complete
- Task 4 (Article System Implementation) is planned next

## Next Steps

1. **Begin Article System Implementation (Task 4)**:
   - Start implementing article filtering and categorization
   - Set up article admin interface
   - Implement SEO optimization for articles
   - Update article components to use new media components

2. **Begin Gallery System Implementation (Task 6)**:
   - Start updating gallery components to use new media components
   - Create dynamic routes for galleries, albums, and cases
   - Implement filtering and sorting options

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Authentication Approach**:
   - Using the newer `@supabase/ssr` package instead of deprecated auth helpers
   - Implemented RLS policies to secure database tables
   - Set up automatic user profile creation on signup
   - Added role-based access control for admin routes
   - Making authentication optional for most public pages, required only for:
     - Admin dashboard access
     - Appointment booking
     - User profile management

2. **Migration Approach**:
   - Preserved original tables with renames (e.g., `media_assets_old`) for safety
   - Successfully migrated from placeholder IDs to direct Cloudinary public IDs
   - Implemented backward compatibility through legacy placeholder IDs in metadata

3. **Component Usage**:
   - New Cloudinary components (CldImage, CldVideo) are replacing existing placeholder components
   - Created adapter logic for backward compatibility with placeholderId
   - The system can now handle both direct Cloudinary IDs and legacy placeholder IDs
