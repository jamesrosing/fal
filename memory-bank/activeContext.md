# Active Context: Article System Implementation

## Current Focus

We're updating the article system to use the new Cloudinary media components and implementing enhanced article management features. This follows our successful completion of the Cloudinary Media System Migration.

1. **Article System Updates**
   - ✅ Updated article content component to use new Cloudinary components
   - ✅ Updated article list page to use new Cloudinary components 
   - ✅ Updated article detail page to use new Cloudinary components
   - ✅ Implemented SEO optimization for articles
   - ⏳ Enhancing article filtering and categorization
   - ⏳ Completing admin interface for article management
   - ⏳ Adding text-to-speech functionality for articles

2. **Cloudinary Media System Integration** (COMPLETED)
   - ✅ Implemented new API endpoints in `/app/api/cloudinary` for direct access to Cloudinary assets
   - ✅ Created asset endpoints that work with direct public IDs rather than placeholder IDs
   - ✅ Created responsive image and transformation endpoints for client-side usage
   - ✅ Removed legacy placeholder-based API endpoints that are no longer needed
   - ✅ Using the established components in `@/components/media` directory (CldImage, CldVideo, etc.)
   - ✅ Created migration guide in `CLOUDINARY-MIGRATION.md` for developer reference
   - ✅ Established direct public ID usage pattern to avoid indirection
   - ✅ Created migration scripts to handle different aspects of the migration

## Cloudinary Best Practices

1. **Use Standard Components**: Always use our standard components from `@/components/media`:
   ```jsx
   import { CldImage, CldVideo, MediaAdapter } from '@/components/media';
   ```

2. **Direct PublicId Usage**: Use the Cloudinary publicId directly in components:
   ```jsx
   <CldImage 
     src="folder/image-name" 
     width={800} 
     height={600} 
     alt="Description" 
   />
   ```

3. **Folder-Based Components**: For content organized by folders, use the folder-based components:
   ```jsx
   <CloudinaryFolderImage
     folder="articles"
     imageName="article-image-name"
     width={800}
     height={600}
     alt="Description"
   />
   ```

4. **Responsive Images**: Use the sizes attribute for responsive behavior:
   ```jsx
   <CldImage
     src="folder/image-name"
     width={1200}
     height={800}
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"
     alt="Description"
   />
   ```

5. **Video Configuration**: Use appropriate video settings based on context:
   ```jsx
   <CldVideo
     src="folder/video-name"
     width={800}
     height={600}
     autoPlay={true}
     loop={true}
     muted={true}
     controls={false} // For background videos
   />
   ```

6. **Type-Based Media Rendering**: For dynamic content, use MediaAdapter:
   ```jsx
   <MediaAdapter
     mediaType={item.type} // "image" or "video"
     src={item.publicId}
     alt={item.alt}
     width={800}
     height={600}
   />
   ```
