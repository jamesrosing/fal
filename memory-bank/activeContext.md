# Active Context: Allure MD Web Application

## Current Work Focus

The project has made significant progress with the completion of both the Cloudinary Media System Integration (Task 3) and Authentication System Implementation (Task 5).

- Task 2 (Database Schema Implementation) is complete
- Task 3 (Cloudinary Media System Integration) is complete
- Task 5 (Authentication System Implementation) is complete
- Task 4 (Article System Implementation) is in progress

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Article System Implementation (Task 4)**:
   - Complete the admin interface for article management
   - Add more comprehensive filtering and categorization options
   - Finish implementing SEO optimization for articles
   - Add text-to-speech functionality

2. **Begin Gallery System Implementation (Task 6)**:

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Cloudinary Component Approach**:
   - Created folder-based Cloudinary components for better organization
   - Added utility functions to simplify image path handling
   - Implemented responsive images with appropriate quality settings
   - Made components flexible to work with both folder paths and direct URLs

2. **Authentication Approach**:
   - Using the newer `@supabase/ssr` package instead of deprecated auth helpers
   - Implemented RLS policies to secure database tables
   - Set up automatic user profile creation on signup
   - Added role-based access control for admin routes
   - Making authentication optional for most public pages, required only for:
     - Admin dashboard access
     - Appointment booking
     - User profile management

3. **Migration Approach**:
   - Preserved original tables with renames (e.g., `media_assets_old`) for safety
   - Successfully migrated from placeholder IDs to direct Cloudinary public IDs
   - Implemented backward compatibility through legacy placeholder IDs in metadata
