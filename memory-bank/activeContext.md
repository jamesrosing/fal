# Active Context: Allure MD Web Application

## Current Work Focus

The project has made significant progress with the implementation of the database schema as specified in the PRD. We have successfully modified all relevant tables while preserving existing data. We are now ready to begin Task 3 (Authentication System Implementation) since Task 2 (Database Schema Implementation) is complete, and Task 3 (Cloudinary Media System Integration) is in progress at approximately 80% completion.

## Recent Accomplishments

### Database Schema Implementation
- Completed major database schema changes:
  - Created a new `media_assets` table with the structure specified in the PRD
  - Updated `galleries`, `albums`, and `cases` tables with missing fields (slug, thumbnail_id, updated_at)
  - Created a new `case_images` table to replace the old `images` table
  - Implemented Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
  - Successfully migrated all existing data to the new schema

### Cloudinary Components Implementation
- Created `CldImage` component with enhanced features:
  - Loading states with skeleton loading
  - Error handling with fallback images
  - Responsive image support
  - Quality and format optimizations
- Created `CldVideo` component with similar enhancements:
  - Loading states
  - Error handling with fallback videos
  - Responsive support
  - Proper event handling
- Created utility functions for Cloudinary transformations
- Updated Next.js configuration for Cloudinary
- Implemented media service for database interaction
- Created migration script for placeholder system

## Current Status
- Task 1 (Project Setup & Environment Configuration) is complete
- Task 2 (Database Schema Implementation) is complete
- Task 3 (Cloudinary Media System Integration) is at 80% completion
  - Core components are built (CldImage, CldVideo)
  - Utility functions are implemented
  - Next.js configuration is updated
  - Media service is created
  - Migration script is developed
  - Remaining work: execute migration script and update component references

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Cloudinary Media System Integration**:
   - Execute the migration script to convert placeholder IDs to direct public IDs
   - Create a phased approach for updating application code references
   - Update component references throughout the application

2. **Begin Authentication System Implementation**:
   - Set up Supabase Auth with email/password authentication
   - Create user profile table and RLS policies
   - Implement login and signup forms with validation
   - Set up role-based access control
   - Create protected routes using Next.js middleware

3. **Planning for Articles and Gallery Implementation**:
   - Begin planning for Task 4 (Article System Implementation) and Task 6 (Gallery System Implementation)
   - These tasks will be started once Task 3 (Cloudinary Media System) is complete

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Migration Approach**:
   - We've preserved original tables with renames (e.g., `media_assets_old`) for safety
   - Application code will be updated to use the new schema
   - A phased approach will be used for updating component references

2. **Component Usage**:
   - New Cloudinary components (CldImage, CldVideo) will replace existing placeholder components
   - Consider creating adapter components for backward compatibility
   - Plan for gradual migration of existing code

3. **Authentication System**:
   - Will leverage Supabase Auth for user management
   - User profiles will store additional user information
   - Role-based access control will be implemented for admin vs. standard users
   - Protected routes will be created using Next.js middleware
