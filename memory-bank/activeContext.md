# Active Context: Article System Implementation

## Current Focus

We're implementing the Gallery System while also continuing work on the article system management features. This follows our successful completion of the Cloudinary Media System Migration and article front-end updates.

1. **Gallery System Implementation**
   - ✅ Updated gallery components to use new Cloudinary components
   - ✅ Fixed gallery hero image display using direct Cloudinary URLs
   - ✅ Implemented responsive design for gallery pages on mobile and desktop
   - ⏳ Creating dynamic routes for galleries, albums, and cases
   - ⏳ Implementing filtering and sorting options
   - ⏳ Creating admin interface for gallery management

2. **Article System Updates**
   - ✅ Updated article content component to use new Cloudinary components
   - ✅ Updated article list page to use new Cloudinary components 
   - ✅ Updated article detail page to use new Cloudinary components
   - ✅ Implemented SEO optimization for articles
   - ✅ Enhanced article filtering and categorization
   - ⏳ Completing admin interface for article management
   - ⏳ Adding text-to-speech functionality for articles

2. **Cloudinary Media System Integration** (COMPLETED)
   - ✅ Implemented new API endpoints in `/app/api/cloudinary` for direct access to Cloudinary assets
   - ✅ Created asset endpoints that work with direct public IDs rather than placeholder IDs
   - ✅ Created responsive image and transformation endpoints for client-side usage
   - ✅ Removed legacy placeholder-based API endpoints that are no longer needed
   - ✅ Using the established components in `@/components/media` directory (CldImage, CldVideo, etc.)
   - ✅ Created migration guide in `CLOUDINARY-MIGRATION.md` for developer reference
   - ✅ Established direct public ID usage pattern to avoid indirection
   - ✅ Created migration scripts to handle different aspects of the migration

## Recent Decisions

- **Gallery Implementation Approach**: Using direct Cloudinary URLs for gallery images rather than the CldImage component to resolve rendering issues.
- **Mobile-First Responsive Design**: Implemented 16:9 aspect ratio on mobile for gallery hero section while using percentage-based height on larger screens.
- **Image Positioning Control**: Using inline style with objectPosition to fine-tune image focal points rather than relying on Cloudinary's gravity parameter.
- **Completed Cloudinary Component Consolidation**: Removed transitional media components in favor of direct Cloudinary integration.
- **Article System Enhancement**: Completed improvements to article filtering, categorization, and now focusing on admin interface development.
- **Advanced Article Filtering**: Implemented more sophisticated article filtering options including tag filtering, search functionality, and subcategory filtering with clean URL parameter handling.

## Cloudinary Best Practices

1. **Use Standard Components**: Always use our standard components from `@/components/media`:
   ```jsx
   import { CldImage, CldVideo, MediaAdapter } from '@/components/media';
   ```

2. **Direct PublicId Usage**: Use the Cloudinary publicId directly in components:
   ```jsx
   <CldImage 
     src="folder/image-name" 
     width={800} 
     height={600} 
     alt="Description" 
   />
   ```

3. **Folder-Based Components**: For content organized by folders, use the folder-based components:
   ```jsx
   <CloudinaryFolderImage
     folder="articles"
     imageName="article-image-name"
     width={800}
     height={600}
     alt="Description"
   />
   ```

4. **Responsive Images**: Use the sizes attribute for responsive behavior:
   ```jsx
   <CldImage
     src="folder/image-name"
     width={1200}
     height={800}
     sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw"
     alt="Description"
   />
   ```

5. **Video Configuration**: Use appropriate video settings based on context:
   ```jsx
   <CldVideo
     src="folder/video-name"
     width={800}
     height={600}
     autoPlay={true}
     loop={true}
     muted={true}
     controls={false} // For background videos
   />
   ```

6. **Type-Based Media Rendering**: For dynamic content, use MediaAdapter:
   ```jsx
   <MediaAdapter
     mediaType={item.type} // "image" or "video"
     src={item.publicId}
     alt={item.alt}
     width={800}
     height={600}
   />
   ```
