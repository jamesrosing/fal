## Known Issues

The following issues have been identified in the development environment:

1. **CloudinaryVideo Infinite Loop** ✓ FIXED
   - **Description**: Maximum update depth exceeded error in CloudinaryVideo component
   - **Root Cause**: useEffect hook causing an infinite loop of state updates in the Hero component
   - **Solution**: Modified the useEffect dependencies array to prevent unnecessary re-renders and added conditional checks before updating state
   - **Status**: Fixed in the latest implementation

2. **Missing Team Provider Placeholder Mappings** ✓ FIXED
   - **Description**: API 404 errors for placeholderIds "team-provider-rosing" and "team-provider-pearose" 
   - **Root Cause**: These placeholder IDs didn't have corresponding entries in the media mapping database
   - **Solution**: Added fallback mappings in the API endpoint to handle these placeholders gracefully
   - **Status**: Fixed in the latest implementation

3. **Image Property Conflicts** ✓ FIXED
   - **Description**: Error about images having both "width" and "fill" properties
   - **Root Cause**: UnifiedMedia component not properly handling conflicting props before passing to Next.js Image
   - **Solution**: Updated UnifiedMedia to intelligently manage these props and prioritize fill when both are present
   - **Status**: Fixed in the latest implementation

These issues are currently prioritized for immediate resolution as part of our media system stabilization efforts.
