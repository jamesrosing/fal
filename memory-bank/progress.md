# Progress: Allure MD Web Application

## What Works

Based on the implementation progress:

- Basic Next.js app router setup is working
- Connection to Supabase database is established
- Basic authentication system is implemented
- ✅ Gallery database structure (galleries → albums → cases → case_images) is fully implemented with all required fields
- ✅ Media assets table is implemented with the structure from the PRD
- ✅ Row Level Security is implemented for all tables
- ✅ Core Cloudinary components (CldImage and CldVideo) are implemented
- Article system is partially implemented

## What's Left to Build

Based on the PRD and our progress, the following components still need to be implemented:

   - Update Next.js configuration for Cloudinary

2. **Database Schema Updates**:
   - ✅ Modify existing tables to match PRD requirements (COMPLETE)
   - ✅ Add missing fields and relationships (COMPLETE)
   - ✅ Implement Row Level Security policies (COMPLETE)
   - ✅ Create migration scripts to preserve existing data (COMPLETE)

3. **Gallery System Enhancements**:
   - Update the gallery system UI to use the new media components
   - Update application code to reference the new schema
   - Create admin interface for management

4. **Articles System Improvements**:
   - Implement categorization and filtering
   - Add text-to-speech functionality
   - Enhance display with new media components
   - Implement SEO optimization

5. **Authentication & User Management**:

   - Implement specialized query handling

8. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement React Query for data fetching and caching
   - Optimize image delivery
   - Enhance loading performance

## Current Status

- **Phase**: Implementation In Progress
- **Progress**: 25%
- **Focus Area**: Cloudinary Media System Integration
- **Active Task**: Task 3 - Cloudinary Media System Integration
- **Completed Task**: Task 2 - Database Schema Implementation

## Key Achievements

1. **Database Schema**:
   - Successfully created and updated all required tables
   - Migrated existing data to the new schema structure

   - Implemented `CldVideo` component with similar enhancements
   - Added support for responsive images and videos

## Implementation Plan

1. **Task 3: Cloudinary Media System (IN PROGRESS)**
   - ✅ Create new `CldImage` and `CldVideo` components (COMPLETE)
   - Create utility functions for transformations and OG images
   - Update Next.js configuration for Cloudinary
   - Create media service to interact with the database
   - Develop migration script from placeholder system

2. **Task 4: Article System Implementation**
   - Update article components to use new media components
   - Implement article filtering and categorization
   - Add SEO optimization for articles
   - Integrate with the new database schema

3. **Task 5: Authentication System**
