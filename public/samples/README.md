# Sample Images for Visual Editor

This folder contains sample placeholder images for the Visual Editor. In a production environment, you should replace these with actual screenshots of your website's pages.

## Sample Images

- `home-preview.jpg` - Preview image for the Home page
- `services-preview.jpg` - Preview image for the Services page
- `about-preview.jpg` - Preview image for the About page
- `contact-preview.jpg` - Preview image for the Contact page

## How to Create Your Own Preview Images

1. Visit each page of your website
2. Take a screenshot of the entire page (or the visible part)
3. Resize the image to a consistent width (we recommend 800px wide)
4. Save the image with the appropriate name in this folder (e.g., `home-preview.jpg`)

The Visual Editor will automatically display these images as thumbnails when selecting which page to edit.
